TrafficFailoverAutomation
Automating the failover of network traffic between routers by manipulating BGP attributes such as Local Preference (LP) and AS Path Prepending. This project ensures seamless failover during maintenance, outages, or performance degradation.

Overview
Failover automation is critical in modern network environments to maintain high availability. This project automates traffic redirection from Router 1 to Router 2 by dynamically adjusting BGP attributes. It uses the Camunda BPMN workflow for orchestration and Python scripts for network configuration and monitoring.

Features
Automated Health Checks: Verifies the status of Router 1.
Dynamic BGP Attribute Adjustment: Updates AS Path Prepending and Local Preference to shift traffic.
Failover Verification: Ensures successful redirection of traffic.
Notifications: Sends email or Slack alerts during the failover process.
Extensible Workflow: Easily modify the BPMN workflow for additional use cases.
Workflow
The Traffic Failover Workflow consists of the following steps:

Start Event: Manual or automated trigger for failover.
Health Check: Ping or telemetry-based check of Router 1.
Decision Gateway:
If healthy: Terminate workflow.
If unhealthy: Proceed to failover.
BGP Attribute Update:
Reduce LP or prepend AS path on Router 1.
Increase LP or remove prepending on Router 2.
Verification: Validate traffic redirection via BGP route advertisements.
Notification: Alert stakeholders via email or Slack.
End Event: Terminate workflow after successful execution.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Camunda Platform: Install Camunda Modeler and Camunda Engine.
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Routers: Set up Cisco/Arista/other routers in Containerlab or a similar environment.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TrafficFailoverAutomation.git
cd TrafficFailoverAutomation
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Import the traffic-failover.bpmn file into Camunda Modeler.
Usage
Start the Workflow:

Use the Camunda cockpit to manually trigger the workflow.
Alternatively, integrate with an API to trigger the process.
Run Python Scripts:

Health Check:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/health_check.py
BGP Attribute Update:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/bgp_failover.py
Send Notification:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/notification.py
Verify Results:

Check the logs or router configurations to validate traffic redirection.
